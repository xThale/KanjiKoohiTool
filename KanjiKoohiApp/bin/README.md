# KanjiKoohiTool

This software allows to convert the export data of the website [Koohii](https://kanji.koohii.com/) to the flashcard memory website [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/en-gb). This was used in order to smoothen the experience for learning new kanji characters. Since Quizlet removed the access to their API for developer, this tool is deprecated. Sadly the source code of this tool was lost before it was uploaded to GitHub. The restored executable was uploaded as a backup afterwards. This tool was developed in C# in order to create a simple GUI and practicing different programming languages.
